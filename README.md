# Cakebook

Here's my React demo for JetCake. After cloning this repository get started by installing the dependencies via `yarn install` or `npm install`.

To try out the demo run `yarn start` or `npm start`. That's it! :tada:

The back end is provided by two API endpoints that I'm hosting with Google as Cloud Functions. The relevant code can be found in `/cloud` and was written with Go.

Thanks to JetCake for this opportunity, hope to hear from your team soon!
